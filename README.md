## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either **spam** or **ham** (legitimate), using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It simulates a real-world scenario where businesses or platforms need to automatically detect and filter unwanted or harmful messages.

The objective was not only to build an effective classifier but also to demonstrate a structured analytical workflow and communicate findings clearly.

## Key Goals

- Clean and preprocess SMS text data  
- Handle class imbalance using oversampling and SMOTE  
- Extract meaningful features using TF-IDF vectorization  
- Train and evaluate classification models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)  
- Communicate insights and performance metrics with clarity  

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- NLTK – text preprocessing  
- Scikit-learn – machine learning and evaluation  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – visualizations  
- Jupyter Notebook – development environment
