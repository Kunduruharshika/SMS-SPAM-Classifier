## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either **spam** or **ham** (legitimate), using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It simulates a real-world scenario where businesses or platforms need to automatically detect and filter unwanted or harmful messages.

Through this work, the goal was not only to build an effective classifier but also to demonstrate a structured analytical workflow and communicate findings clearly.

## Key Goals

- Clean and preprocess SMS text data  
- Handle class imbalance using oversampling and SMOTE  
- Extract meaningful features using TF-IDF vectorization  
- Train and evaluate classification models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)  
- Communicate insights and performance metrics with clarity  

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- NLTK – text preprocessing  
- Scikit-learn – machine learning and evaluation  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – visualizations  
- Jupyter Notebook – development environment
